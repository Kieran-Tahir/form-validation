## Overview

This repo is designed to teach you how to validate a charity donation form using regular expressions. First we are going to write regexes that match the following:

- First name (max 20 characters, no symbols)
- Last name (max 20 characters, no symbols)
- Realistic date of birth (not over 150 years)
- Email address
- Amount of money to donate

Then we are going to create a form that allows a user to input these values and validate those with our regexes. This kind of 'form validation' is a common feature in many websites. It is essential for preventing invalid, junk or malicious inputs in our site. üê±‚Äçüíª

### Step 1

- Create a file called ```regex.js```
- In this file you are going to create variables for each of the inputs listed above. Each of these will be defined as ```new RegExp()```
- Inside the brackets you will write your own regexes for each of the variables.
- Export these variables

### Step 2

- Create a file called ```Form.jsx```
- Add the ```Form.jsx``` component to ```App.jsx```
- In ```Form.jsx```:
    - Import React and useState.
    - Import your regexes from ```regex.js```
    - Add state for each variable.
    - Add 'error' state for each variable
    - Create input fields that take input data for each variable.
    - In each input field add an ```onChange``` that sets the input data as the state for the corresponding variable.
    - Create a function called ```validate``` that checks the input value against the regexes you wrote in ```regex.js```. Try this yourself first, and if you are having trouble - check the hint below.

```
function validate () {
      if (!validEmail.test(email)) {
         setEmailErr(true)
      }
   }
```

</details>

### Step 3

- Create a button that calls the validate function when clicked.
- If the input is not valid then display 'This input is invalid'

### Step 4

Now it is time for you to apply this concept to your personal project!
